# DND-Maths
A collection of scripts and programs that do things related to Dungeons and Dragons/Pathfinder.

## Arithmancy
This is a script that calculates the arithmancy value of a spell. It works successfully. (Pathfinder)

## Sacred Geometry
This is a script that calculates the solution to the sacred geometry problem for a spell. This is incomplete, since the algorithm isn't straight-forward and needs to be worked out theoretically first. A brute-force approach is very inefficient. (Pathfinder)

## Random Fighter
This is a small application to generate random fighters. (Pathfinder)
